# How to create repository in GitHub and to check it out in your local computer:

1. Choose a project name and create a new repository in GitHub online with that name.
2. Add a ReadMe.md file to it. The ending ".md" enables you to format your text in the file.
3. Create the folder and subfolder {your_project_name}/{your_project_name} in your computer, where you want to have a copy of the project.
4. Copy the URL of your repository from Github. For example: "https://github.com/daamcat/SmallTestsQml.git/"
5. Right click on subfolder {your_project_name}/{your_project_name} and SVN Check-out. Paste the URL of your repository in the field "URL of repository".
6. Click on OK and check out. Two folders will appear in your created folder:
 - {your_project_name}/{your_project_name}/branches
 - {your_project_name}/{your_project_name}/trunk
Your "ReadMe" file will be in {your_project_name}/{your_project_name}/trunk folder.

Now whatever you do in the folder /trunk/, you can "commit" in your GitHub.
Have fun! ;)
